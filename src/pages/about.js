            <p>I'm Mehnaz. Variety is the spice of life, thus my interest in different kind of hobbies and activities keep me busy.
                I love traveling and it gives me an opportunity to engage in my favorite hobby, photography. </p>
            <p>Some of my activities involve being outdoors to enjoy natureâ€™s beauty, going hiking or just hitting the gym to
                keep in shape. At home, I spend time with my cats, as they are great stress relievers, read a book and meditate to 
                free my mind of everything, basically recharging myself for another new day. </p>
            <p>There are moments when I pen down my thoughts, which led me towards poetry and writing blogs. Sometimes, sharing 
                your experiences opens you up to different arenas of life and in doing so I have come across many interesting 
                individuals and their share of life encounters.</p>
            <p>I created this blog site to share some of my thoughts. Hopefully, you will enjoy reading my blogs, as much as 
                I enjoyed creating them</p>
